# DFT-of-an-Image
Python Prgogram to find the DFT of an Image

Required packages/ library : Open CV, Numpy, matplotlib.
Program Str. 
1. import library
2. get the input image and covert to gray scale 
3. Transform the image to improve the speed in the FT calculation
4. Calculate the DFT
5. output of CV2.dft() function will be 3-D numpy arry, for 2-D Output, 2D DFT as two part complex and real part. so need to convert as we required. 
6. Reconstruct the image using the inverse Fourier transform
7. Displayling  input image, Gray Scale image, DFT of the Input Image 

#For Run the Program 

Open the DFT_Image done.py in your Python IDE. 

Give the Path of your Input image.

and run the program.
